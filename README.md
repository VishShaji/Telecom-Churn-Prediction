# 🚀 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project 🚀

![Project Logo or Header Image](path-to-header-image)

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an Iranian telecom company using advanced machine learning techniques. By identifying key factors leading to customer churn, businesses can proactively address at-risk customers and enhance retention strategies. 

We employ cutting-edge models such as **XGBoost** to handle imbalanced data, and interpret results using **SHAP** for explainability.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, usage metrics (call durations, unique numbers called, etc.), and a churn label indicating whether the customer has left the service.

More details can be found at the [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset).

## 📈 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and outlier removal.
- **Modeling with XGBoost**: Hyperparameter-tuned gradient boosting model.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Using inbuilt scale_pos_weight parameter of XGBoost to handle class imbalance.
- **Model Interpretability**: Using SHAP to explain feature importance and model behavior.
- **Performance Metrics**: ROC curve, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out

1. **Real-World Application**: Offers a practical solution for businesses to minimize customer churn and retain valuable customers.
2. **Advanced Techniques**: XGBoost with RandomSearchCV hyperparameter ensures robust predictions.
3. **Explainable AI**: SHAP values make the model’s decisions transparent and understandable, which is crucial for business decisions.
4. **Modular and Scalable**: Easily adaptable for other datasets and industries facing customer churn issues.

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, scaled, and preprocessed to handle missing data and outliers.
2. **Model Training**: XGBoost is employed as the primary classifier, tuned with hyperparameter optimization.
3. **Churn Prediction**: Predictions are made on customer data to identify potential churners.
4. **Model Explainability with SHAP**: SHAP values are used to interpret individual predictions and feature importance.
